# hello-world
my first project here on github

Hello everyone, my username is  wearable-R.
Im new to git hub so I don't now much about it.
I mainly want to learn software engineering. I don't now much about any proggraming language but I now a bit and im still learning.
I have only learned a little bit of a few programming languages,
so I hope github helps me to become a senior software engineer.

thanks for reading, bye
